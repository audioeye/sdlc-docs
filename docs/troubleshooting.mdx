# Troubleshooting

## Unable to download packages

### Verify your entitlement token

Refer to the [Pre-Requisites](./get-started#pre-requisites) section to verify your entitlement token is correct.

### Check the Cloudsmith status page

Visit the [Cloudsmith status page](https://status.cloudsmith.io/) under _Package Downloads (CDN)_ to see if there are
any known issues.

## Rules Not Running or Issues Missed

### Check what rules work

Refer to the [How Rules Work in Different Testing Scenarios](./about_our_rules) page.

### Testing production versus pre-prod HTML

The Testing SDk was not designed to be run against live production URL. Try downloading the HTML for the page you want
to test to a file, then run the CLI against the local file. If you are trying to test pages that live behind an
authentication flow, we recommend using Cypress.
