# Troubleshooting

## Unable to download packages

### Verify your entitlement token

Refer to the [Pre-Requisites](./get-started#pre-requisites) section to verify your entitlement token is correct.

### Check the Cloudsmith status page

Visit the [Cloudsmith status page](https://status.cloudsmith.io/) under _Package Downloads (CDN)_ to see if there are
any known issues.

## Rules Not Running or Issues Missed

### Check what rules work

Refer to the [How Rules Work in Different Testing Scenarios](./about_our_rules) page.

### Testing production versus pre-prod HTML

The Testing SDK was designed to be used in development environments. If you want to use it to test production sites, you
can download the HTML for the page you want to test then run the CLI against the local file, or you can test directly
against the live site. If you are trying to test pages that require an authentication flow, we recommend using Cypress.
