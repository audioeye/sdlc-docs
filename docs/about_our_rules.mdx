# About Our Rules

## How Does Automated Testing Work?

The Accessibility Testing SDK lets you use AudioEye's automated testing suite to analyze your site and get details of
the issues discovered.

Each individual test in the automated test package is called a rule (RuleCode). Rules are based on specific criteria we
expect are present in your site or code, as defined by WCAG guidelines.

WCAG guidelines are complex and comprised of multiple criteria, some of which cannot be measured accurately by automated
testing. If a rule does not detect any issues, it doesnâ€™t mean the WCAG guideline itself is passed. Rather, the details
or expected behavior written in each rule are present.

## Understanding AudioEye's Rules

Depending on the type of testing you are conducting -- like if you are using the `--component` flag (the only option
during Jest testing) or if you are running a full page scan -- the set of accessibility rules that will be run is
slightly different. Not all rules apply to individual html components, and similarly some issues can only be detected
during a full page scan. To see what tests are being run use the `--print-test-list` flag on the CLI when running a
scan.

```bash
% npx aetest scan --component --print-test-list < component.html

## Describing a Rule

If you need more details about a specific issue, you can use the `describe` command to get more information. For
instance, for the result `Img_Name_Missing` you can find more information by running:

```bash
% npx aetest describe Img_Name_Missing
{
  code: 'Img_Name_Missing',
  fullName: 'Image accessible name is missing',
  description: "We detected an image that is missing an accessible name. if the image is unimportant or decorative, provide an empty-alt attribute as in the following: `alt=''`. If the image needs announcing to screen-readers, add an appropriate alt-attribute or related ARIA property to provide an accessible name.",
  wcagSuccessCriteriaNumber: '1.1.1',
  wcagSuccessCriteriaName: 'Non-Text Content',
  wcagSuccessCriteriaLevelCode: 'A',
```
