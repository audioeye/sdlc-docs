# Introduction

AudioEyeâ€™s Accessibility Testing Software Development Kit (SDK) helps web developers test code for accessibility issues
in their local, staging, or CI/CD environments.

Checking for issues early in the development process makes it easier to fix those problems at the source and reduces the
volume of issues that make it into your production environments.

## Types of Testing

There are three ways the Accessibility Testing SDK can help detect issues in your code:

- Component-level testing using Jest
- Single-page testing using the CLI
- Automated browser-based (aka workflow) testing using using Cypress

See each page for more details on requirements, what to install, how to execute a test pass, and what results to expect
for each of these methods.
